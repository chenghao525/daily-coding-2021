## Problem Description
```
Given an integer array nums (0-indexed) and two integers target and start, find an index i such that nums[i] == target and abs(i - start) is minimized. Note that abs(x) is the absolute value of x.

Return abs(i - start).

It is guaranteed that target exists in nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 5, start = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: nums[4] = 5 is the only value equal to target, so the answer is abs(4 - 3) = 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], target = 1, start = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: nums[0] = 1 is the only value equal to target, so the answer is abs(0 - 0) = 0.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], target = 1, start = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Every value of nums is 1, but nums[0] minimizes abs(i - start), which is abs(0 - 0) = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 104
0 <= start < nums.length
target is in nums.

```

## Thought
- Iterate through array find the number
- Compare the distance

## Keypoints
- Array


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int getMinDistance(int[] nums, int target, int start) {
        int min = nums.length;
        int pos = 0;
        
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i] != target)
                continue;
            if(Math.abs(i-start) < min){
                pos = i;
                min = Math.abs(i-start);
            }
        }
        return min;
    }
}
```
