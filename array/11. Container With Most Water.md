## Problem Description
```
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
Example 4:

Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104
```

## Thought
- Two pointer from left and right
- Calculate the area between
- Keep the longer one and move the shorter index inward.

## Keypoints
- Array, Two pointers


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int l = 0, r = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;
        int area = 0;
        
        while(l != r){
            if(height[l] < height[r]){
                area = height[l] * (r-l);
                l++;
            }else{
                area = height[r] * (r-l);
                r--;
            }
            
            if(area > maxArea)
                maxArea = area;
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```
