## Problem Description
```
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 4:

Input: x = -101
Output: false
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
```

## Thought
- Use modulo and divide operator to calculate reversed number value
- Compare it with orignial number


## Keypoints
- Modulo, divide


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if(x < 0) return false;
        int num = 0;
        int temp = x;
        
        while(temp != 0){
            num *= 10;
            num += temp % 10;
            temp /= 10;
        }
        return x == num;
    }
}
```
